## Features
- Visualization of assets and locations.
- Energy sensor, critical assets, and text search filters.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.19.6
- Dart SDK

## Project points to improve
- I would add tests (I plan to add soon)
- I would add caching, so I don't have to make requests every time
- I would seek to further optimize the appâ€™s performance
- I would look for better ways to implement, refactoring my current code (I plan to do it soon)
